This repository contains the examples from the book Essential Three.js I'm currently writing for Packt. This
book shows, using a couple of complex examples, how to work with the most common features of Three.js.

This repo will contain the source code for the 6 large examples (chapters 2 to 7) and the examples to get you
started will be in chapter 1.
